// typescript is a super set of javascript that allows us to write code in a more structured way
// it is a statically typed language, which means that we have to define the type of the variables
// it allows us to write code that is more readable and maintainable
// it is compiled to javascript, so it can run in any browser
// it is a superset of javascript, so it can run in any browser
// typescript is like writing javascript with a precise syntax
// type script is all about type safety
// type safety is a way to prevent errors in our code
// ex in javascript we can add 2 + '2' and it will return 22 as a string which is not what we want
// in typescript we can't do that, we have to define the type of the variables
// ex null + 2 will return 2 in javascript, but in typescript it will return an error
// what typescript does - static checking of the code
// static checking is a way to check the code before it runs
// it checks the code for errors before it runs in the ide or the editor
// it checks the code for errors before it runs in the browser
// typescript is a deveopment tool our project still runs in the javascript
// it is done to avoid errors in the code
